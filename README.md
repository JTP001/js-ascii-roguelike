# js-ascii-roguelike
This project was for me to practice more with JavaScript and try out something like making a simple game. 

I followed this tutorial (https://code.tutsplus.com/how-to-make-your-first-roguelike--gamedev-13677t) to learn how to use Phaser and make ascii gameplay, and then I added my own elements to it like levels with increasing difficulty and heal spaces.

To run the game, download the files into the same folder and open index.html in your browser.
